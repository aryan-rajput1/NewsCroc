This is a React application that displays news articles based on different categories like Sports, Business, Entertainment, etc. The application is made up of several components: App, NavBar, News, and NewsItem.

The App component is the main component that contains a router and switches between different routes to display news articles. The NavBar component is used to display a navigation bar that allows the user to select different categories. The News component is responsible for fetching news articles from a news API and rendering them on the screen. Finally, the NewsItem component is used to display individual news articles.

The App component also contains a LoadingBar component that is used to display a progress bar while the news articles are being loaded. The progress of the loading bar is controlled by the setProgress function that is passed down to the News component as a prop.
